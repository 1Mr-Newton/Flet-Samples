# Startup Name Generator

I made this after watching an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxsLRRY2xZA&t=3007s) of Flet's creator and core dev (Feodor Fitsner).
The idea was to reproduce apps made with Flutter with Flet, exposing how easy and cool it is to build UIs with Flet.

To be brief, this "Startup Name Generator" comes from [Flutter's CodeLab tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0) made mainly for beginners starting with the framework.

This program doesn't generate true Startup names as compared to the Flutter one.
I left this out because I didn't find a python package to do that, and also wanted to leave out some extra complexity and keep things simple.
