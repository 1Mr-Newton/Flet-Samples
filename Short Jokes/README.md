### Where are the jokes from?
All the jokes you will see while using this app are served by [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/).
To make the user experience good for everyone, I decided to blacklist some flags(_nsfw, racist, sexist, explicit_) and exposed only two(_programming and christmas_) from the six available categories.

Feel free to fork/clone this project and modify the parameters to your likings.

### Why this project?
I wanted to expose the possibility of communicating with APIs while using Flet for the frontend.

### Project Architecture/Structure
There are three main files: `main.py`, `utils.py` and `joke.py`.
The first two files contain the frontend/UI of the app, while the last file contains the backend communication with the API (fetching, parsing). 

### Contribution/Issues
If you face any issue or have any question, please drop it in the issue tracker, and I will reply as soon as possible.
On the other hand, if you wish to contribute(_ex: typos, UI/UX improvement_) to this project, please fork this repo, and make a pull request, which after review and discussion will be possibly merged.
